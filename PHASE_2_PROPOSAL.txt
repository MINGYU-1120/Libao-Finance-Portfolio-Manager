**Phase 2: Secure Backend Data Access**

We are now ready to implement Phase 2.
Current State: App Check is enabled and blocking unauthorized requests.

**Next Steps:**
1. Create a `functions` directory (if not exists) for Firebase Cloud Functions.
2. Draft a secure Callable Function to fetch `ai_picks`.
3. Implement basic Rate Limiting (e.g. using Redis or Firestore counters) within the function.
4. Update frontend to call this function instead of direct `getDocs`.

Do you want to proceed with creating these Cloud Functions?
